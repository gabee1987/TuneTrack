          <h3>1. Who We Are</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>App name:</strong> TuneTrack<br />
            <strong>Platform:</strong> Android (and later iOS)<br />
            <strong>Contact email:</strong>
            <a href="mailto:gabee1987@gmail.com">gabee1987@gmail.com</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our data
            practices, you can contact us at the address above.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Information We Collect</h3>
          <p>
            TuneTrack does not collect personal information from users for the
            purpose of transmission to, or storage by, the developer. The app
            only requests the device camera permission (for QR scanning and
            gameplay camera features). Spotify authentication is performed with
            the user's own Spotify account; any Spotify tokens are stored
            securely on the user's device only.
          </p>

          <h4>2.1. Spotify authentication and local storage</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              When you connect TuneTrack to your Spotify account the app obtains
              an OAuth access token from Spotify to enable playback. This token
              and any refresh token are stored locally on your device using
              secure storage mechanisms (Expo SecureStore).
            </li>
            <li>
              These tokens are not sent to or stored on any servers owned by the
              developer. They remain on your device to allow the app to interact
              with Spotify on your behalf.
            </li>
            <li>
              Spotify account use is subject to Spotify's terms and privacy
              policy.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>2.2. Camera</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The App requests the <code>CAMERA</code> permission.</li>
            <li>
              Camera use is strictly limited to gameplay features such as
              scanning QR codes and live camera interactions. Camera access is
              used only while you are using the relevant features.
            </li>
            <li>
              We do not capture, transmit, or store raw camera images or video
              streams outside your device.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you disable camera permission, camera-based features will not
            function.
          </p>

          <h3>3. How We Use Information</h3>
          <p>
            We use information only to enable the app features on your device
            (for example, to play music using your Spotify access token). The
            developer does not collect or transmit your personal data to any
            server.
          </p>

          <h3>4. Legal Bases for Processing (EU/EEA Users)</h3>
          <p>
            If you are located in the European Union / European Economic Area,
            we process your personal data on the following legal bases:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Performance of a contract:</strong> To provide the App and
              its features, including Spotify integration.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Consent:</strong> When you grant Spotify permissions or
              allow camera access.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> To maintain and improve the
              App, prevent abuse, and ensure security.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>You can withdraw your consent at any time by:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Disconnecting TuneTrack from your Spotify account,</li>
            <li>Revoking permissions in your device settings (e.g. camera),</li>
            <li>Uninstalling the App.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>5. How We Share Your Information</h3>
          <p>
            We do <strong>not</strong> sell or rent your personal data to third
            parties. We may share data only in the following situations:
          </p>

          <h4>5.1. Spotify</h4>
          <p>
            When you connect the App to Spotify, we share requests and tokens
            with Spotify in order to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Authenticate your account</li>
            <li>Access music playback and related metadata</li>
            <li>
              Perform actions you explicitly request within the App (e.g. play
              tracks)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Your relationship with Spotify is governed by Spotify's terms and
            privacy policy.
          </p>

          <h4>5.2. Legal Requirements</h4>
          <p>
            We may disclose information if we believe in good faith that such
            action is necessary to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Comply with a legal obligation or government request,</li>
            <li>Protect and defend our rights or property,</li>
            <li>
              Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the
              App,
            </li>
            <li>
              Protect the personal safety of users of the App or the public.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>6. Data Retention</h3>
          <p>
            We retain data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes
            described in this Privacy Policy or as required by law.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Locally stored data (e.g. tokens, preferences) remain on your
              device until you clear them, disconnect your account, or uninstall
              the App.
            </li>
            <li>
              If we store any server-side data (e.g. logs or metrics), we keep
              it only as long as needed for debugging, security, and improvement
              of the App.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you disconnect your Spotify account or uninstall the App, we will
            no longer receive new data from your account.
          </p>

          <h3>7. Data Security</h3>
          <p>
            We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect
            your data against unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. However, no
            method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot
            guarantee absolute security.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are responsible for keeping your device secure and controlling
            access to the App and your Spotify account.
          </p>

          <h3>8. Your Rights (EU/EEA and Similar Jurisdictions)</h3>
          <p>
            Depending on your location, you may have the following rights
            regarding your personal data:

            You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data
            protection authority.
          </p>

          <h3>9. Third-Party Links</h3>
          <p>
            The App may contain links to third-party websites or services (for
            example, links to Spotify or other resources). We are not
            responsible for the privacy practices of those third parties. We
            encourage you to review their privacy policies.
          </p>

          <h3>10. Children's Privacy</h3>
          <p>
            TuneTrack itself does not collect personal data and therefore can be
            used by children of any age. However, some features (Spotify
            playback) rely on the user's Spotify account.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Spotify accounts are governed by Spotify's terms and age
              requirements. If a child is below the minimum age in their
              country, they should not create or use a Spotify account without
              parental consent.
            </li>
            <li>
              Parents and guardians are responsible for supervising their
              children's use of TuneTrack and for any Spotify account used with
              the app. The developer does not request or store children's
              personal data.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
          <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make
            material changes, we will update the "Effective date" at the top of
            this document.
          </p>
          <p>
            We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any
            changes.
          </p>
