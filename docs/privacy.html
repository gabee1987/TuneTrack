          <p><strong>App name:</strong> TuneTrack<br/><strong>Platform:</strong> Android (and later iOS)<br/><strong>Contact email:</strong> <a href="mailto:gabee1987@gmail.com">gabee1987@gmail.com</a></p>

          <h3>2. Information We Collect</h3>
          <p>We collect and process information only to provide the core functionality of TuneTrack, improve the App, and ensure it works as intended.</p>

          <h4>2.1. Information You Provide</h4>
          <p>When you use TuneTrack, you may provide us with:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Spotify login / account connection</strong><br/>When you connect TuneTrack to your Spotify account, we receive an access token and certain information from Spotify, such as:</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Your Spotify account ID</li>
            <li>Basic profile information (e.g. display name)</li>
            <li>Information needed for music playback or track selection (e.g. currently playing track or playlists), depending on the permissions you grant.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We do <strong>not</strong> receive your Spotify password.</p>

          <h4>2.2. Information from Spotify</h4>
          <p>TuneTrack uses the Spotify Web API to access music and related metadata. The exact data we receive depends on the permissions (scopes) you grant when logging in.</p>
          <p>This may include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Basic profile information (e.g. display name, country, language)</li>
            <li>Playback-related information (e.g. currently playing track, playback state)</li>
            <li>Music metadata (e.g. track name, artist, album, cover image)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We use this data only to provide the core gameplay and music-related features in the App.</p>
          <p>For more information about how Spotify processes your data, please see <a href="https://www.spotify.com/legal/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">Spotify’s Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

          <h4>2.3. Camera</h4>

          <ul>
            <li><code>CAMERA</code></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Camera is used for in-app features such as scanning QR codes and interacting with game elements that require live camera input.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Camera access is used only while you are using the relevant features.</li>
            <li>We do not store raw camera images or video streams on our servers.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Microphone / Audio</h4>
          <p>TuneTrack does not request microphone access in production builds and does not record audio. Any references to audio recording or microphone permission in development were removed from production configuration.</p>

          <h4>Third-Party Inspiration and Intended Use</h4>
          <p>TuneTrack was inspired by other music discovery/party apps. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by any other app or company. This project is developed for private, non-commercial use by the author and their close relatives/friends; there is no intention to monetize or distribute user data.</p>
          <p>If you have concerns about similarity to another app, please contact us at the address below.</p>

            <li>Crash and performance data (e.g. error logs)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This information is typically collected via the mobile platform (e.g. Google Play Services / Expo services) and is used to improve stability and user experience.</p>

          <h4>2.5. Local Storage (On Your Device)</h4>

            <li>Your in-app preferences and settings</li>
