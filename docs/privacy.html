              TuneTrack is a music party game that uses Spotify links — players
              try to identify the song being played and guess its release year.

            <h3>1. Who We Are</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>App name:</strong> TuneTrack<br /><strong
                >Platform:</strong
              >
              Android (and later iOS)<br /><strong>Contact email:</strong>
              <a href="mailto:gabee1987@gmail.com">gabee1987@gmail.com</a>
            </p>

            <h4>2.2. Spotify authentication and local storage</h4>
            <p>When you connect TuneTrack to your Spotify account, the app obtains an OAuth access token from Spotify to enable playback. This token and any refresh token are stored locally on your device using secure storage mechanisms (Expo SecureStore). These tokens are not sent to or stored on any servers owned by the developer; they remain on your device to allow the app to interact with Spotify on your behalf.</p>

            <h4>2.3. Camera</h4>
            <p>The App requests the <code>CAMERA</code> permission. Camera use is limited to gameplay features such as scanning QR codes and live camera interactions. Camera access is used only while you are using the relevant features. We do not capture, transmit, or store raw camera images or video streams outside your device.</p>

            <h4>2.4. Microphone / Audio</h4>
            <p>TuneTrack does not request microphone access in production builds and does not record audio.</p>

            <h4>2.5. Third-Party Inspiration and Intended Use</h4>
            <p>TuneTrack was inspired by other music discovery/party apps. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by any other app or company. This project is developed for private, non-commercial use by the author and their close relatives/friends; there is no intention to monetize or distribute user data.</p>
              We use this data only to provide the core gameplay and
              music-related features in the App.
            </p>
            <p>
              For more information about how Spotify processes your data, please
              see
              <a
                href="https://www.spotify.com/legal/privacy-policy/"

                >Spotify’s Privacy Policy</a
              >.
            </p>

            <h4>2.3. Camera</h4>
            <p>The App requests the following Android permission:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>CAMERA</code></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Camera is used for in-app features such as scanning QR codes and
              interacting with game elements that require live camera input.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Camera access is used only while you are using the relevant
                features.
              </li>
              <li>
                We do not store raw camera images or video streams on our
                servers.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Microphone / Audio</h4>
            <p>
              TuneTrack does not request microphone access in production builds
              and does not record audio. Any references to audio recording or
              microphone permission in development were removed from production
              configuration.
            </p>

            <h4>Third-Party Inspiration and Intended Use</h4>
            <p>
              TuneTrack was inspired by other music discovery/party apps. It is
              not affiliated with or endorsed by any other app or company. This
              project is developed for private, non-commercial use by the author
              and their close relatives/friends; there is no intention to
              monetize or distribute user data.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you have concerns about similarity to another app, please
              contact us at the address below.
            </p>

            <h4>2.4. Device and Usage Information</h4>
            <p>
              When you use TuneTrack, we may automatically collect some
              technical information, such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Device model, operating system, language, and region</li>
              <li>App version</li>
              <li>
                Anonymous usage data (e.g. which screens are opened, basic
                interaction patterns)
              </li>
              <li>Crash and performance data (e.g. error logs)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This information is typically collected via the mobile platform
              (e.g. Google Play Services / Expo services) and is used to improve
              stability and user experience.
            </p>

            <h4>2.5. Local Storage (On Your Device)</h4>
            <p>
              TuneTrack may store certain data locally on your device, for
              example:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Authentication tokens (e.g. Spotify access/refresh tokens) using
                secure storage mechanisms
              </li>
              <li>Your in-app preferences and settings</li>
              <li>Game state or progress data</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This data is stored <strong>only on your device</strong> and is
              not automatically shared with us or third parties, except as
              needed to communicate with Spotify or other services for App
              functionality.
            </p>

            <h3>3. How We Use Your Information</h3>

              Your relationship with Spotify is governed by Spotify’s terms and

            </p>

            <h4>5.2. Service Providers</h4>
            <p>
              We may use third-party services to help us operate or improve the
              App (for example, error reporting, crash analytics, or hosting).
              These providers may process limited data on our behalf, under
              contracts that require them to protect your information.
            </p>

            <h4>5.3. Legal Requirements</h4>
            <p>
              We may disclose information if we believe in good faith that such
              action is necessary to:

              <li>
                Protect the personal safety of users of the App or the public.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>6. Data Retention</h3>
            <p>
              We retain data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the
              purposes described in this Privacy Policy or as required by law.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Locally stored data (e.g. tokens, preferences) remain on your
                device until you clear them, disconnect your account, or
                uninstall the App.
              </li>
              <li>
                If we store any server-side data (e.g. logs or metrics), we keep
                it only as long as needed for debugging, security, and
                improvement of the App.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>

            </p>

            <h3>7. Data Security</h3>
            <p>
              We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to
              protect your data against unauthorized access, loss, or misuse.
              However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and
              we cannot guarantee absolute security.
            </p>
            <p>
              You are responsible for keeping your device secure and controlling
              access to the App and your Spotify account.
            </p>
