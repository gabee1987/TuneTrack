  ## 2. Information We Collect

  TuneTrack does not collect or transmit any personal user data to the developer or to any external servers. The app only requests the device camera permission for gameplay (QR scanning / camera features). Spotify authentication is performed via the user's own Spotify account and tokens are stored securely on the user's device only.

  ### 2.1. Spotify authentication and local storage

  - When you connect TuneTrack to your Spotify account, the app obtains an OAuth access token from Spotify to enable playback. This token and any refresh token are stored locally on your device using secure storage mechanisms (Expo SecureStore).
  - These tokens are not sent to or stored on any servers owned by the developer. They remain on your device to allow the app to interact with Spotify on your behalf.

  ### 2.2. Camera

  - The App requests the `CAMERA` permission.
  - Camera use is limited to gameplay features such as scanning QR codes and live camera interactions.
  - We do not capture, transmit or store raw camera images or video streams outside your device.

  If you disable camera permission, camera-based features will not function.

- To show and manage your game state, scores, and related content
- To improve the App’s performance, stability, and user experience
- To debug issues and prevent abuse or misuse of the App

We do **not** sell your personal data.
