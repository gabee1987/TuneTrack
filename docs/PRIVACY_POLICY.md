# Privacy Policy for TuneTrack

**Effective date:** December 9, 2024

This Privacy Policy describes how TuneTrack ("we", "us", or "our") handles information when you use the TuneTrack mobile application (the "App").

By using the App, you agree to the terms below.

---

## 1. Who We Are

**App name:** TuneTrack  
**Platform:** Android (and later iOS)  
**Contact email:** gabee1987@gmail.com

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our data practices, you can contact us at the address above.

---

## 2. Information We Collect

TuneTrack does not collect personal information from users for the purpose of transmission to, or storage by, the developer. The app only requests the device camera permission (for QR scanning and gameplay camera features). Spotify authentication is performed with the user's own Spotify account; any Spotify tokens are stored securely on the user's device only.

### 2.1. Spotify authentication and local storage

- When you connect TuneTrack to your Spotify account the app obtains an OAuth access token from Spotify to enable playback. This token and any refresh token are stored locally on your device using secure storage mechanisms (Expo SecureStore).
- These tokens are not sent to or stored on any servers owned by the developer. They remain on your device to allow the app to interact with Spotify on your behalf.
- Spotify account use is subject to Spotify's terms and privacy policy.

### 2.2. Camera

- The App requests the `CAMERA` permission.
- Camera use is strictly limited to gameplay features such as scanning QR codes and live camera interactions. Camera access is used only while you are using the relevant features.
- We do not capture, transmit, or store raw camera images or video streams outside your device.

If you disable camera permission, camera-based features will not function.

## 3. How We Use Information

We use information only to enable the app features on your device (for example, to play music using your Spotify access token). The developer does not collect or transmit your personal data to any server.

---

## 4. Legal Bases for Processing (EU/EEA Users)

If you are located in the European Union / European Economic Area, we process your personal data on the following legal bases:

- **Performance of a contract:** To provide the App and its features, including Spotify integration.
- **Consent:** When you grant Spotify permissions or allow camera access.
- **Legitimate interests:** To maintain and improve the App, prevent abuse, and ensure security.

You can withdraw your consent at any time by:

- Disconnecting TuneTrack from your Spotify account,
- Revoking permissions in your device settings (e.g. camera),
- Uninstalling the App.

---

## 5. How We Share Your Information

We do **not** sell or rent your personal data to third parties. We may share data only in the following situations:

### 5.1. Spotify

When you connect the App to Spotify, we share requests and tokens with Spotify in order to:

- Authenticate your account
- Access music playback and related metadata
- Perform actions you explicitly request within the App (e.g. play tracks)

Your relationship with Spotify is governed by Spotify's terms and privacy policy.

### 5.2. Legal Requirements

We may disclose information if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to:

- Comply with a legal obligation or government request,
- Protect and defend our rights or property,
- Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the App,
- Protect the personal safety of users of the App or the public.

---

## 6. Data Retention

We retain data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy or as required by law.

- Locally stored data (e.g. tokens, preferences) remain on your device until you clear them, disconnect your account, or uninstall the App.
- If we store any server-side data (e.g. logs or metrics), we keep it only as long as needed for debugging, security, and improvement of the App.

If you disconnect your Spotify account or uninstall the App, we will no longer receive new data from your account.

---

## 7. Data Security

We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data against unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

You are responsible for keeping your device secure and controlling access to the App and your Spotify account.

---

## 8. Your Rights (EU/EEA and Similar Jurisdictions)

Depending on your location, you may have the following rights regarding your personal data:

- Right of access – to request a copy of your personal data.
- Right to rectification – to correct inaccurate or incomplete data.
- Right to erasure – to request deletion of your data where applicable.
- Right to restriction of processing – to limit how we use your data.
- Right to data portability – to receive your data in a commonly used format.
- Right to object – to object to certain types of processing.

To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at gabee1987@gmail.com.

You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.

## 9. Third-Party Links

The App may contain links to third-party websites or services (for example, links to Spotify or other resources). We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those third parties. We encourage you to review their privacy policies.

---

## 10. Children's Privacy

TuneTrack itself does not collect personal data and therefore can be used by children of any age. However, some features (Spotify playback) rely on the user's Spotify account.

- Spotify accounts are governed by Spotify's terms and age requirements. If a child is below the minimum age in their country, they should not create or use a Spotify account without parental consent.
- Parents and guardians are responsible for supervising their children's use of TuneTrack and for any Spotify account used with the app. The developer does not request or store children's personal data.

## 11. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the "Effective date" at the top of this document.

We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
