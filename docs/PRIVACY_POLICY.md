## 2. Information We Collect

We collect and process information only to provide the core functionality of TuneTrack, improve the App, and ensure it works as intended.

### 2.1. Information You Provide

When you use TuneTrack, you may provide us with:

- **Spotify login / account connection**  
  When you connect TuneTrack to your Spotify account, we receive an access token and certain information from Spotify, such as:
  - Your Spotify account ID
  - Basic profile information (e.g. display name)
  - Information needed for music playback or track selection (e.g. currently playing track or playlists), depending on the permissions you grant.

We do **not** receive your Spotify password.

### 2.2. Information from Spotify

TuneTrack uses the Spotify Web API to access music and related metadata. The exact data we receive depends on the permissions (scopes) you grant when logging in.

This may include:

- Basic profile information (e.g. display name, country, language)
- Playback-related information (e.g. currently playing track, playback state)
- Music metadata (e.g. track name, artist, album, cover image)

We use this data only to provide the core gameplay and music-related features in the App.

For more information about how Spotify processes your data, please see Spotify’s own Privacy Policy.

### 2.3. Camera and Microphone

The App requests the following Android permissions:

- `CAMERA`
- `RECORD_AUDIO`

**Camera**

TuneTrack uses the camera for in-app features such as scanning codes or interacting with game elements that require camera input.

- Camera access is used **only while you are using these features**.
- We do not store raw camera images or video streams on our servers.

**Microphone**

TuneTrack may request access to the microphone because of the underlying camera/recording functionality used by the App.

- At the time of this policy, we do **not** store audio recordings on our own servers.
- If a feature uses microphone input (e.g. for specific game mechanics), audio is used only to provide that feature and is not stored longer than necessary.

If you disable camera or microphone permissions, some features of the App may not function correctly.

### 2.4. Device and Usage Information

When you use TuneTrack, we may automatically collect some technical information, such as:

- Device model, operating system, language, and region
- App version
- Anonymous usage data (e.g. which screens are opened, basic interaction patterns)
- Crash and performance data (e.g. error logs)

This information is typically collected via the mobile platform (e.g. Google Play Services / Expo services) and is used to improve stability and user experience.

### 2.5. Local Storage (On Your Device)

TuneTrack may store certain data locally on your device, for example:

- Authentication tokens (e.g. Spotify access/refresh tokens) using secure storage mechanisms
- Your in-app preferences and settings
- Game state or progress data

This data is stored **only on your device** and is not automatically shared with us or third parties, except as needed to communicate with Spotify or other services for App functionality.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information for the following purposes:

- To provide and operate TuneTrack and its features
- To enable integration with Spotify and play music during the game
- To authenticate you via Spotify and maintain your session
- To show and manage your game state, scores, and related content
- To improve the App’s performance, stability, and user experience
- To debug issues and prevent abuse or misuse of the App
